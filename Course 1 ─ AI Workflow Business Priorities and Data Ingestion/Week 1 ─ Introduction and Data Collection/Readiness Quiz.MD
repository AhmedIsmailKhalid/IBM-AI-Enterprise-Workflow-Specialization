Please note that the 1st quiz, i.e. the readiness quiz is <b>INCOMPLETE</b> with missing answers to some questions. This is because of the errors in the online compiler and the grader used in this course.
Some known common issues with this quiz are :
* The compiler will give a runtime error (unexpected end of runtime error or something similar)
* The compiler will give an InfraError (I don't know what this even means)
* The grader will mark CORRECT ouptut as INCORRECT

The above mentioned issues have been brought to the attention of the course staff but there has been no response received by them. Due to this lack of feedback on the issues, I did not bother with the quiz as there was no reason to believe that the issues would have been resolved and the weightage of the quiz (1%) was simply not worth the time or the effort
